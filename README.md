This is the database file for the "Can I Fly There" browser app created for FSEconomy.net. 

The purpose here is to have a publicly accesible file that others can edit when they find changes which need to be made. The most common change will probably be
renaming fields in FSE wich have a different ICAO code in MSFS 2020. Below is an example of how to make the change when one is found....

"00V":{"status":"renamed","simIcao":"KFLY"}

Simply means that 00V is the field as found in FSE, and KFLY is the one in MSFS. 

#### Observation
Please make sure to update only airports that actually exist in that ***exact*** same spot. 
Otherwise we don't think it's a good idea to do it, as either these missing airports may be created by people or eventually added by MSFS updates, potentially becoming an issue later.
